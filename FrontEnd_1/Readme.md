# FrontEnd - Project - VueJS and TailwindCSS

In this portfolio project, I am showcasing a minimalist todo list application designed for both mobile and web views. The project leverages the power of Vue.js for dynamic front-end functionality and utilizes the sleek and responsive Tailwind CSS framework for an enhanced user interface.

## Objectives 

The primary aim of this project is to create a **user-friendly home page** featuring a **list of tasks** scheduled for the current date. Additionally, the application will provide a preview of upcoming projects with their respective end dates. Notably, all data storage and manipulation will be performed exclusively on the client-side, eliminating the need for a backend.

## Technology Used

- **VueJs** : Vue.js is the core framework driving the dynamic behavior of the application. It enables efficient data binding, component-based architecture, and interactive user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS** : Tailwind CSS is responsible for the elegant and responsive design of the application. It streamlines the styling process, ensuring a consistent and visually pleasing user experience.

- **Task Management**: Users can easily add, edit, and remove tasks, making it a convenient tool for tracking daily responsibilities.

- **Upcoming Projects**: The application provides a snapshot of forthcoming projects, ensuring users stay organized and prepared.

- **Client-Side Data Storage**: All data, including tasks and project details, is stored locally on the client-side, eliminating the need for server-side database interactions.

## Futur Enhancements

- **User Authentication**: Incorporating user accounts and authentication for personalized task management.

- **Data Synchronization**: Implementing synchronization with a backend server to enable data sharing and access across multiple devices.

- **Task Prioritization**: Adding features to prioritize tasks based on urgency or importance
